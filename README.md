## Extract assignments
This bash script is created to extract files from blackboard. Blackboard has a
horrible way of creating a zipfile. This tries to fix it.

## References
This guy helped me in making the bashscript useable for other people:

You'll notice that some of the code is directly copied, but also altered to fit
my needs.
